tacrolimusTDM is an application designed for simulating the pharmacokinetic profile of tacrolimus, a crucial immunosuppressive agent in renal transplantation. Tacrolimus, when compared with ciclosporin, has shown a reduced incidence of acute rejection, making it a cornerstone in immunosuppressive therapy. Optimizing immunosuppressive management in the early post-transplant period is vital for achieving long-term graft function and survival. To enhance the outcomes of renal transplantation, tacrolimus has been combined with novel immunosuppressive agents like mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and sirolimus. These combinations have shown promising results in terms of patient and graft survival, reduced acute rejection rates, and improved renal graft function. Tacrolimus, particularly when combined with MMF, demonstrated superior graft survival in patients with delayed graft function and better outcomes compared to ciclosporin microemulsion plus MMF immunosuppression.
